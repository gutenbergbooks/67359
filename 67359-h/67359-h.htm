G. D. TURNBOW</p>


<hr class="short" />

<p>Butter boxes used in shipping and storing butter in California,
are usually made of spruce which is largely shipped in from other
states particularly from Washington and Oregon.</p>

<p>With the recent war, however, there came an acute shortage of
spruce on the Pacific Coast with a corresponding increase in price.
The commercial manufacturers did some work in an attempt to find
a substitute for spruce, but the trade did not readily accept a change.
There was a demand from both the lumber and the butter interests
for investigation to find a suitable substitute for spruce.</p>

<p>The production of spruce is somewhat limited in California, but
there is an abundance of white fir and a limited amount of cottonwood
available. However, the creamerymen have not used white fir and
cottonwood to any extent for butter containers, on account of the
belief that these materials would impart a wood flavor to the butter.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as nearly all of the butter made in this State is shipped
or stored in wooden containers, the use of white fir or cottonwood,
would mean first, a material saving to the butter manufacturers in
marketing expense, and second, an opportunity for the lumber interests
to use a large amount of raw material already available in
California, which heretofore had been of little commercial value
or use.</p>


<h3>BUTTER ABSORBS ODOR</h3>

<p>The volatile fats in butter have the property of absorbing odors,
which often results in an undesirable flavor. Great care then must
be exercised in keeping butter from coming in contact with materials
that will impart a foreign flavor. Butter need be exposed to foreign
odors only a short length of time before the flavor is permanently
affected.</p>


<p>Experiments<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
 were conducted, therefore, to determine whether
white fir or cottonwood would impart a flavor to the butter and also
to determine the possibility of storing butter in cubes and marketing
it in 60-pound cases when these woods were used.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<h3>CUBE BUTTER IN COLD STORAGE</h3>

<p>The butter for cold storage was packed in white fir, cottonwood,
and spruce containers holding ten pounds each. Both seasoned and
unseasoned woods were used in each of the three methods of packing.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp81" id="image004" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image004.jpg"
   alt="Fig. 1.—Butter packed in cubes paraffined and parchment lined." />
   <div class="caption">Fig. 1.—Butter packed in cubes paraffined and parchment lined.</div>
</div>

<p>The first set packed with butter were plain unseasoned boxes of
each of the woods. The second set had the inner surface paraffined
before packing. The method of paraffining was to invert the box
over a steam jet and steam thoroughly. This served a double purpose
in that it opened the pores of the wood and allowed the paraffin
to penetrate, and the heated surface of the wood kept the paraffin in
a liquid condition so that it could be put on in a thinner coat than
if the paraffin had been applied to a cold surface. After the boxes had
been allowed to drain, the inside was then painted with paraffin at
240° F. This method gave a complete covering to the wood, a result
which is not always obtained by some of the commercial paraffin
atomizers. The third set was paraffined as above and, in addition,
lined with good parchment paper so that no butter could come in
contact with either wood or paraffin (fig. 1). Twenty-three 10-pound
boxes were packed in the three ways.</p>

<p>They were filled with the butter from one churning which scored
92½ after being chilled for 24 hours at 50° F. and were shipped
immediately after the first scoring to a cold storage plant in San
Francisco and stored at a temperature of 12° F. The butter was
scored monthly for six months. The summary of the scoring is given
in <a href="#table1">table 1</a>.</p>

<h3>SIXTY-POUND BOXES PACKED FOR MARKET</h3>

<p>The butter for market was cut into two-pound squares, wrapped
and packed in 60-pound containers, made of white fir, cottonwood and
spruce (figs. 2, 3 and 4). The butter was stored in a cold room, the
temperature of which ranged from 48° to 50° F. It was held in
storage twenty-eight days, which is within two days of the maximum
time butter may be held and still sold as fresh butter. Butter held
over thirty days must be labeled “storage butter.” The butter was
scored four times during the storage period. The butter used was all
from the same churning which scored 93 after being chilled for
twenty-four hours at 50° F.</p>

<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> gives a summary of the scores showing the effect upon
butter in containers with varying treatments. When paraffined, the
inside of the boxes was painted with the paraffin at 240° F.</p>

<h3>NAILING OF BOXES</h3>

<p>Five-penny cement-coated nails were used in making the boxes.
Practically no splitting was caused by the nails in unseasoned white
fir, spruce, or cottonwood. There was very little splitting in seasoned
cottonwood. The nails, however, caused a slight splitting in the
seasoned spruce and quite a noticeable splitting in the white fir, but
not enough in either to cause an appreciable loss.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>


<h4>Cube Butter in Cold Storage</h4>

<p><i>Boxes paraffined and parchment lined.</i>—White fir and cottonwood
can be used in place of spruce for storing butter in cubes, when
properly seasoned, paraffined, and parchment lined.</p>

<p>Cottonwood is equal to spruce as a butter container. Butter stored
in cottonwood boxes for six months had an average score of 0.048 of
a point above spruce treated in the same manner.</p>

<p>White fir may be used very successfully. It scored during the
six months’ storage only an average of 0.381 of a point below spruce.</p>

<p>In the final scoring, after six months’ storage, none of the cubes
packed in seasoned, paraffined and parchment lined containers received
a cut directly due to wood flavor.</p>

<p>Green or unseasoned white fir, cottonwood or spruce, may impart
a slight wood flavor to the butter when packed in cubes, even though
they are paraffined and parchment lined. The butter stored in
unseasoned cubes scored an average of 0.218 of a point below the
butter stored in seasoned boxes with the same treatment. While the
average difference was very small, in some cases there was a decided
wood flavor which was pronounced enough to affect materially the
flavor of the butter.</p>

<p><i>Boxes paraffined but not parchment lined.</i>—Unseasoned boxes of
white fir, cottonwood and spruce, paraffined but not parchment lined
are not entirely satisfactory for storing butter. The butter so stored
was criticized in practically all cases for wood flavor. Butter stored
in white fir boxes scored 0.358 of a point lower than that in spruce
boxes, while butter in cottonwood boxes scored 1.071 lower than that in
spruce. Storing butter in cubes without parchment lining or in cubes
carelessly lined with parchment will cause objectionable flavors
regardless of the wood.</p>

<p><i>Boxes neither paraffined nor parchment lined.</i>—Butter allowed to
come in direct contact with any of the three untreated woods will
always take up wood flavor. The injury to the flavor is about equal
from all three woods.</p>


<h4>Sixty-Pound Boxes Packed for Market</h4>

<p>White fir is as good as spruce for 60-pound boxes when seasoned
and parchment lined, the butter being wrapped in parchment only.
Cottonwood is not quite as satisfactory as either spruce or white fir,
there being some criticism on the flavor of the butter.</p>

<p>Butter can be shipped in seasoned white fir or cottonwood boxes,
lined with ordinary wrapping paper, if the butter is parchment
wrapped and cartoned. There is no advantage in using parchment
paper to line the box.</p>

<p>Since there was practically no trouble experienced in the unparaffined
boxes, there is no advantage in paraffining the inside of the box.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the investigational work, approximately
40,000 white fir boxes have been used with entire satisfaction for
shipping butter at the University Farm.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
